## About the Project
**PET**

Write a class named Pet, which should have the following data attributes:

• ``__name`` (for the name of a pet)

• ``__animal_type`` (for the type of animal that a pet is. Example values are ‘Dog’, ‘Cat’, and ‘Bird’)

• ``__age`` (for the pet’s age)

The Pet class should have an __init__ method that creates these attributes. It should also have the following methods:

• set_name()

This method assigns a value to the __name field.

• set_animal_type()

This method assigns a value to the __animal_type field.

• set_age()

This method assigns a value to the __age field.

• get_name()

This method returns the value of the __name field.

• get_animal_type()

This method returns the value of the __animal_type field.

• get_age()

This method returns the value of the __age field.

Once you have written the class, write a program that creates an object of the class and prompts the user to enter the name, type, and age of his or her pet. This data should be stored as the object’s attributes. Use the object’s accessor methods to retrieve the pet’s name, type, and age and display this data on the screen.

3. Create the getter and setters.

4. Create another file for the objects.

5. Import the class Pet.

6. Create the object.

7. Ask the user for the needed information.

8. Print the information.

## Running the Program

1. Input the information being asked.

2. Run the program.
